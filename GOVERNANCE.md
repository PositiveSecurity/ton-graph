# Project Governance

This document defines how decisions are made for the TON Graph project.

## Roles

- **Maintainers** – individuals with write access to the repository and publishing rights on the VS Code Marketplace. Maintainers review pull requests, triage issues and manage releases.
- **Contributors** – anyone submitting patches or issues via GitHub.

## Decision-Making Process

1. All changes are proposed through GitHub pull requests.
2. A pull request requires approval from at least two maintainers before merging.
3. Discussions take place in issues or pull request threads. Consensus is reached when no maintainer objects for 48 hours after the last approval.

## Quorum

For decisions involving new features, releases or policy updates, a quorum of two maintainers is required. If fewer than two maintainers are active, project owners may appoint additional maintainers.

## Dispute Resolution

If maintainers disagree and cannot reach consensus, project owners from PositiveWeb3 make the final call.
